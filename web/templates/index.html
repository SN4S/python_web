            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                At c0vid bat, we serve a selection of the most unusual and exotic Asian cuisine you’ll find anywhere. Our passion for rare ingredients and bold flavors is what sets us apart. Each dish is thoughtfully crafted using ingredients that are often hard to come by and sourced from distant regions, including China.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Due to the rarity of our ingredients, the availability of our dishes changes frequently. We believe in giving our guests a fresh and exclusive experience with every visit. Some of our dishes may not be available after just one order, as certain ingredients are limited in quantity but shared among several creations.
